## 📋 Phase 3 & 4 Priorities (In Order)

### 1️⃣ **Lead Pipeline (Single Source of Truth)**
**Priority:** HIGH - Do this first
**Why:** Nothing slips through cracks, track true conversion funnel
**Tools:** Notion, Airtable, or simple CRM (Pipedrive/HubSpot free)
**Fields needed:**
- Name, Email, Phone
- Event type, Date/range, Guest count
- Loft/Airbnbs interest
- Source (Website, GMB, Instagram, Airbnb, Peerspace, Referral)
- Status: `New → Tour booked → Toured → Proposal sent → Booked → Lost`

**Automation:** Webhook from contact form → Auto-create lead row

---

### 2️⃣ **Follow-Up Email Sequences**
**Priority:** HIGH - Closes deals
**Why:** Most venues lose money in the "inquiry → silence" gap

**Templates needed:**
1. **Immediate auto-reply** (✅ You have this)
2. **24-48hr follow-up:** "Circling back - want to tour this week?"
3. **Post-tour same-day:** Recap + date hold + pricing
4. **Post-tour 2-3 days:** "Any questions? Can soft-hold for 24hrs"
5. **Nurture (monthly):** "Still have 2025 dates + weekday specials"

**Implementation:** Gmail templates + Zapier/n8n OR manual with canned responses

---

### 3️⃣ **Lodging as Sales Weapon**
**Priority:** MEDIUM - Differentiator
**Why:** Justifies higher pricing, increases revenue per booking

**Actions:**
- Make "Stay steps from celebration" a headline
- Create bundles:
  - "Weekend Wedding + Loft Suite"
  - "Full Weekend with Loft + 2 Airbnbs"
- Decide: 2-night minimum? Bundle discounts?

**Status:** ✅ Section already created, needs copy enhancement

---

### 4️⃣ **Push Discovery: GMB + Social + Vendors**
**Priority:** MEDIUM - Feed traffic
**Why:** Site is ready, now need visitors

**Google My Business:**
- Add description
- Categories: "Wedding venue", "Event venue", "Banquet hall"
- 10-20 photos (empty space, decor, Loft, Strand area)
- Weekly posts: "Booking 2025", "Weekday specials", "Tour this month"

**Instagram/TikTok:**
- 10-15s walkthroughs
- Loft Suite "get ready" content
- "3 reasons to get married in downtown Galveston"
- Every post CTA: "Tour & book at theos.live"

**Local Vendors:**
- DM photographers, planners, caterers, DJs
- Offer styled shoots at friendly rates
- Add to "preferred vendors" list on site
- Ask for backlinks/referrals

---

### 5️⃣ **Track Real Metrics**
**Priority:** MEDIUM - Data-driven decisions
**Why:** Know what's working, optimize pricing

**KPIs to track:**
- Website → Contact section scroll rate
- Website → Form submission rate
- Form submissions → Tours booked
- Tours → Bookings
- Revenue per: Saturday, Fri/Sun, Weekday, Micro, Content

**Current:** ✅ Google Analytics set up, need to create custom dashboards

---

### 6️⃣ **AI for Operations**
**Priority:** LOW - Efficiency
**Why:** Scale operations, hand off to staff

**Use AI for:**
- Contract templates
- Vendor agreements
- Event day checklists
- SOPs: "How a Saturday wedding runs"
- Cleanup/damage policies

---

### 7️⃣ **Future Enhancements**
**Priority:** LATER
- Online booking + deposits (Stripe)
- Day-specific promos
- Peerspace listing for photo/video
